# CI tests for native platform
The purpose of these tests is to routinely test and get coverage metrics for classes related to interaction with modems. These can't be tested without a modem, so they will be done on a machine (most likely, a Raspberry Pi) that has a modem connected.

Each test will test a single class in `modem` subdirectory.
